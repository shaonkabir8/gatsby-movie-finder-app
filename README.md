# Dashboardbox

This is a movie SPA (Single Page Application) built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) API. My goal with this project was to create a movie dashboard app where you can search,sort and filter movies using real data as well as getting a quick overview of each movie.

## Features

Besides filtering, sorting and searching, there are others features I implemented in this project, below I provide a list of some very popular libraries that I used to make things easier.

- lodash to create the pagination component
- axios for the http request
- react-toastify to show a message in the UI in case of unexpected errors
- react-router-dom to handle routing
- react-reveal for the fade in animation effect

there other libraries that I used but the listed above are the main ones, you can always see the rest in the package.json file.
